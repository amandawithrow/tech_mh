I don&#39;t need my new employers judging me off the bat and having a reason to not give me the job because someone equally qualified who doesn&#39;t over share and talk about their problems is given the job instead of me. I also am lucky that work is a place where I often function better than I do at home. Personally, I do better when I don&#39;t allow myself the option to give into depressive episodes at work. But that&#39;s just my experience. I&#39;ve worked at companies where my supervisor knew I was dealing with depression and addiction recovery and it didn&#39;t help me at all. He didn&#39;t understand and I made it easier for myself to slack off. At my new job I haven&#39;t told anyone and Even though I think they&#39;d be more supportive and understanding, I feel better that I keep my personal issues out of the work place. Though I understand completely that other people who have mental health issues are not as lucky to be as functional as I am. </td>

<td>Depends greatly on the job involved.  I can adapt quickly to jobs involving heavy lifting, for example, but would not admit that it would probably wind me to start with.

<td>No</td>
<td>Mental health issues are hugely stigmatized.  I made the mistake of letting my last employer find out that I had ADHD and an adderall prescription not really thinking about it.  The head of engineering would joke about me &quot;doing meth&quot; after that at horrible moments including me (I have no degree) interviewing a PhD candidate who had done groundbreaking work in SMP and threaded rendering at SGI in the 90s and was all around awesome.  Luckily he made a joke about not talking about the shrooms he did to lighten that one, but there were many worse situations.  I was considered one of the most valued employees because of my ability to get anything done with the LLVM compiler system.  One day I pointed out to the manager in question that he was on a higher dosage of the same medication I was on, and the stupid meth jokes got worse from there.  It&#39;s not really a light accusation to make on somebody given our country&#39;s state of drug law, something which I am something of an activist for reform of.  It was was degrading. I was also made fun of for being autistic despite that not being a disorder I have.  </td>

Most people do not realize that I have something wrong with my brain chemistry not that I am a terrible person or want to be this way. I do great work and I have had my current job for 6 years.

<td>It depends on the physical health issue. There are too many companies in tech that worship the &quot;dev rock star&quot; stereotype where long hours and the sacrifice of work balance is held in higher regard. They will work devs to the bone if we allow them too. Any resistance to working too many hours is labeled as &quot;rebellion&quot;. I&#39;ve worked jobs where I had to strategically plan my days off because I couldn&#39;t afford to lose all my PTOs and as a result, have forced myself to go to work even while having asthma or being sick. Basically, if I&#39;m not half dead, then I can make it to work because I need to &quot;save those days for when I really need it&quot;.</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>The stigma makes me wary of bringing up mental health issues during an initial interview. I feel like the more I get to know a job and it&#39;s people, that determines how comfortable I am with being open about my mental health. I feel like it&#39;s too risky to bring up in an interview where both parties don&#39;t know one another well enough. I have anxiety and depression, which can also include focus/motivation issues. I feel like mentioning things like this would give the impression that I&#39;m not a good employee who can get things done. However that&#39;s not true. I am very responsible and will meet deadlines so long as I can work when I&#39;m most productive and there are flexible schedules.</td>

<td>See my answer above. I don&#39;t want to risk a possible position or cast a pall over the rapport with a potential coworker. I didn&#39;t always feel this way, but at my last position I got strongly warned, in secret, never to say anything about my condition because people would think I was &#39;crazy&#39; and &#39;might shoot up the place.&#39; I have major clinical depression that I&#39;ve managed and treated for years. The only person it&#39;s hurt is myself. But that was the perception of anyone with a mental illness, never mind that they&#39;re as wide a spectrum as physical illnesses.

<td>AT least at the places I have worked - IT in banking..it was a very macho hardass culture across the board. In nonprofit spots - the budgets were so tight everyone complained all the time and had it hard...not as hard as me with untreated ADHD, depression and anxiety...but hard. It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance now so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn&#39;t have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. <br/>I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. <br/>What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it&#39;s women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.<br/><br/>I can&#39;t just say it&#39;s about me...I&#39;m under water because no one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a &quot;master of the universe&quot; type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a &quot;liberatarian&quot;... <br/><br/>So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I&#39;m screwed NOT just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.<br/><br/>Sooo - this survey should have a &quot;Did we miss anything&quot; open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn&#39;t be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. No mercy. No understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn&#39;t well.. I couldn&#39;t defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I&#39;m OK now...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female. There was NO space for me to be anything less that 120% perfect as I was one of very few women working in SV at the time.</td>

I&#39;m still mad about it even though I kind of get it from their standpoint. They even made me turn in a doctor&#39;s note that they&#39;re keeping on file.
